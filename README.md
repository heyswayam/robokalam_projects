## ROBOKALAM INTERNSHIP PROJECTS

This repository contains two tasks as follows:
### Task-1

For Assignment 1, I have created a web template layout that includes space for a live instruction video and space for showing the live video of the student listening to it. I have also added buttons that enable the webcam and features such as live chat and emojis. I used Tailwind as the frontend library.
### Task-2

For Assignment 2, I have created a form with basic input fields such as name, email, passwords, etc. I integrated MongoDB for database integration. Upon clicking the submit button, the form data will be saved in the database and a success page will be shown. I used Bootstrap for frontend and Express.js for running the backend server and MongoDB for the database.
